## Setup

1. Clone repo and `yarn install`
2. Create [MongoDB Atlas database](https://www.mongodb.com/atlas/database)
3. Set up SendGrid API (for email validation)
   - Information about SendGrid API keys: https://docs.sendgrid.com/ui/account-and-settings/api-keys
4. Set up Amazon AWS s3 bucket (for photo storage)
   - https://cs52.me/assignments/sa/s3-upload/
5. Create a `.env` file in the root directory
  - Should be in the following format:
  - ```
    AUTH_SECRET='*secret assortment of characters used for encryption*'
    PORT=*insert desired backend server port here*
    MONGODB_URI=mongodb+srv://...
    MONGODB_DB_NAME=
    AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=
    AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=
    S3_BUCKET_NAME=
    SENDGRID_EMAIL=
    SENDGRID_API_KEY=
    ```
6. Run `yarn migrate-mongo up` to apply migrations and seeding to DB.
7. App should be ready for use now
  - `yarn start` to run in production mode
  - `yarn run dev` to run with hot reloading

#### Linting

ESLint is set up in this project. To keep code clean, always remember to run `yarn run lint` and fix any lint problems before merging into master.

#### Unit Testing

Jest unit testing is set up for the controllers, routers, and services. Remember to run `yarn test` and fix any breaking changes that might've occured. 
  - You can also run just an individual test file with `yarn test -- *filename*`
